Setting ReactOnRails configuration for `build_production_command` is
not necessary if you have config/webpack/production.js. When that file
exists, React on Rails DOES NOT modify the standard assets:precompile.
If you want React on Rails to modify to the standard assets:precompile
to use your config/initializers/react_on_rails.rb config.build_production_command
then delete the config/webpack/production.js.

Setting ReactOnRails configuration for `build_production_command` is
not necessary if you have config/webpack/production.js. When that file
exists, React on Rails DOES NOT modify the standard assets:precompile.
If you want React on Rails to modify to the standard assets:precompile
to use your config/initializers/react_on_rails.rb config.build_production_command
then delete the config/webpack/production.js.

Setting ReactOnRails configuration for `build_production_command` is
not necessary if you have config/webpack/production.js. When that file
exists, React on Rails DOES NOT modify the standard assets:precompile.
If you want React on Rails to modify to the standard assets:precompile
to use your config/initializers/react_on_rails.rb config.build_production_command
then delete the config/webpack/production.js.

Setting ReactOnRails configuration for `build_production_command` is
not necessary if you have config/webpack/production.js. When that file
exists, React on Rails DOES NOT modify the standard assets:precompile.
If you want React on Rails to modify to the standard assets:precompile
to use your config/initializers/react_on_rails.rb config.build_production_command
then delete the config/webpack/production.js.
